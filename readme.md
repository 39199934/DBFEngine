This is a simple program that allows people to read and write FoxPro files with the .bdf file extension.
This is NOT a complete implementation, it was done without ANY official specifications and was done by reverse engineering a file with a hex editor to a large degree.  It currently supports numbers,integers, floats, doubles, and character strings and logicals.  It will treat all unhandled data types as if they are character fields.
